For some reason it will not let me clone, no matter what I change. But first you have to click the file you just made, then click clone. You will then pick the location where you want it to go.
Name: Nick Smith
school email: nasmith9@my.waketech.edu
one I used to make this: thenicksmith77@icloud.com
Repository I made: Has a readMe file, uses 1 branch, is public, and is in my downloads.
Like I said, for some reason my laptop is not letting me clone, but the steps are to find the file you want to clone, click clone file, then find or add a folder to put it in.
